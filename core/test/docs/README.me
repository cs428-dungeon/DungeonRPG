Running All Test classes:
    From Intellij:
        In order to run a test class from intellij Right click the test sources folder and say run all tests.
    From Gradle:
        If you are compiling from the command line in order to run all tests you would use the command gradlew test.

Running and Creating Test Suites:
             Think of a test suite as being something like UnitTestSuite, ComponentTestSuite. You create a test class
             that runs more than one test class, but less than every test class
             We will want to do these in order to organize our tests well.

    From Intellij:
        You can create test suite classes that will run only certain test classes, you can see UnitTestSuite.class
        as an example. To run from Intellij just right click the testSuite class and click run
    From Gradle:
        This is a bit more complicated. Once you have created a test Suite go into the DungeonRPG build.gradle and
        create a task that looks like this:

        task JunitSuite(type: Test) {
                include '**/UnitTestSuite.class'
                reports.junitXml.destination = "$buildDir/test-results/YourOutputFile"
                reports.html.destination = "$buildDir/test-results/YourOutputFile"
            }

        then you can run from the command line by doing gradlew clean JunitSuite(or whatever you named your task above).

     Even though we will most likely all be running tests from inside intellij, I think it would be beneficial if we had gradle commands
     for our test suites. This is more for industry standard type stuff than it is for what we need. Its good practice.
